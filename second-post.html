<p>It's only like 10 weeks later, right?  Lots of updates: I was in the <a href="https://avc.sparkfun.com/">SparkFun Autonomous Vehicle Competition</a>, am almost done with term 1 <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/syllabus/core-curriculum">Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree</a>, and was accepted into both Galvanize and Metis's data science intensives, and will be taking the plunge with Metis in NYC in January!</p>
<p>I will update with more expansive explanations soon.  Part of the reason I didn't write previously was because I felt like it would have been a lot of "I'm doing this and I have no real idea why!" posts, and also because I was unfamiliar with Markdown which this glorious Pelican blog is written in.  Also I constructed a Django blog, but I did it quickly and haven't had much time to make it not look like I learned how to code in 1993.</p>
<p>There. I said some feelings.  No problems were solved, this was purely about me.  Truly a second blog post!</p>
